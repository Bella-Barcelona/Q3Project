    Casa : 

    The Casa Program encourages the transformation of children from ages 3 to 5 as 
    they consciously and willingly learn from their environment. The students form 
    their personalities and develop their will and intelligence, using their senses 
    to explore, discover, and manipulate the Montessori materials in the prepared 
    environment.

    Primary :

    In the Primary Grade School Program, the classroom's prepared environment aids 
    the intellectual and physical development of students from ages 6 to 8 until they
    achieve independence from adults and gain confidence as they relate to the world.

    Grade School : 

    In the Intermediate Grade School Program, the students from ages 9 to 12 deepen 
    their knowledge about their universal responsibility to care for life and the 
    environment. The curriculum enhances academic proficiency while facilitating 
    teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership skills.

    Junior High School :

    Our Junior High School Program supports the emotional, psychological, and social 
    transformation of students from ages 13 to 16 as they prepare for adult 
    responsibilities. The curriculum focuses on strengthening critical skills like 
    problem-solving, collaboration, and communication by harnessing their creative 
    energies as they begin to seek economic independence.

    Senior High School :
    
    The Senior High School Program further equips the students ages 17 and 18
    with the skills and knowledge necessary for future success. The curriculum is
